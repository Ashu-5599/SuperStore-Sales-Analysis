```

### **Profit Margin Calculation**
```DAX
Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales]) * 100
```

### **Total Orders Count**
```DAX
Total Orders = COUNT(SuperStore[Order ID])
```

### **Average Order Value (AOV) Calculation**
```DAX
AOV = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Orders])
```

### **Top 5 Cities by Sales**
```DAX
Top Cities Sales = 
TOPN(
    5,
    SUMMARIZE(SuperStore, SuperStore[City], "City Sales", SUM(SuperStore[Sales])),
    [City Sales], DESC
)
```

### **Return Rate Analysis**
```DAX
Return Rate = COUNT(SuperStore[Returns]) / COUNT(SuperStore[Order ID])
```

### **Most Profitable Category Calculation**

```

### **Least Profitable Category Calculation**
